![Incident Response at PagerDuty](./assets/img/headers/pagerduty_ir.jpg)

This documentation covers the Vox Media Incident Response process. It is forked from PagerDuty's open source incident response documentation and updated to reflect Vox Media practices and values. We use it to prepare new employees for on-call responsibilities and inform our protocol before, during, and after any incident.

!!! warning "Is an incident happening right now?"
    Take a deep breath and go to the [during an Incident](during/during_an_incident.md) page.
