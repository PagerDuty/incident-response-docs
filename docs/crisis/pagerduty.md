## PagerDuty Configuration
How to set up your Crisis Response Management instance in PagerDuty:

[PagerDuty Mobile app](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/mobile-app) - Ask each member to install and configure the mobile app for maximum reachability.

[User Management](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/users#add-users) - Make sure you’ve added your Executive Crisis Leadership and Crisis Response Team members to the system.

[Contact information](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/user-profile) - Ask each member to log into the web application and update their profile information including their phone, email and SMS contact information especially if they’ve changed devices.

[Notification rules](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/user-profile#notification-rules) - Ask each member to set their high urgency, low urgency, handoff and subscriber notification rules under their profile.

[Teams](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/teams) - create teams for your Executive Crisis Leadership Team, each of your Crisis Team Leaders, and essential support functions like Crisis Communications, IT or Legal

[Services](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service) - create and configure a service for each of your crisis categories led by your Crisis Team Leaders, e.g., supply chain, human resources, critical infrastructure, geopolitics, physical security, etc.

[Urgency](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/service-settings#notification-urgency) - set your notification urgency for each service whether high, low, dynamic or based on operating hours

[Escalation policies](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/escalation-policies#create-an-escalation-policy) - decide who gets notified first and how long before the notification escalates to the next team member and configure round robin scheduling if you wish to alternate per crisis

![Escalation policies determine which responders are contacted](../assets/img/crisis/11_escalationpolicy.png)

[Integrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#add-integrations-to-an-existing-service) - add your instant messaging, video conferencing tool or create a custom email integration or connections to other systems for triggering alerts

[Schedules](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/schedule-basics#create-a-schedule) - create your on-call rotations for the teams associated with each crisis service
