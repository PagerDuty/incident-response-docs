# PagerDuty Incident Response Documentation [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/PagerDuty/incident-response-docs/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/PagerDuty/incident-response-docs)
This is a public version of the Incident Response process used at PagerDuty. It is also used to prepare new employees for on-call responsibilities, and provides information not only on preparing for an incident, but also what to do during and after. See the [about page](docs/about.md) for more information on what this documentation is and why it exists.

You can view the documentation [directly](/docs/index.md) in this repository, or rendered as a website at https://response.pagerduty.com.

## Development
We use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to create a static site from this repository. For local development,

1. Install v0.15.3 of [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation). `pip install mkdocs==0.15.3`
1. Install v0.2.4 of the [MkDocs Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). `pip install mkdocs-material==0.2.4`
1. To test locally, run `mkdocs serve` from the project directory.

## Deploying
1. Run `mkdocs build --clean` to produce the static site for upload.
1. Upload the `site` directory to S3 (or wherever you would like it to be hosted).

        aws s3 sync ./site/ s3://[BUCKET_NAME] \
          --acl public-read \
          --exclude "*.py*" \
          --delete
